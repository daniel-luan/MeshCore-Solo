## External Keyboard & Joystick

[Go back](../../README.md)

Two optional, auto-detected hardware add-ons — a build with them enabled runs
the same with nothing plugged in. Two of the newer boards also ship with
their own **built-in** keypad instead —
see [Built-in keyboards](#built-in-keyboards-cardputer-adv-t-echo-lite--keyshield).

- **CardKB** — an M5Stack I2C QWERTY keyboard (address `0x5F`), for typing
  messages, names and labels without walking the on-screen letter grid.
- **Wired joystick** — four direction contacts plus a Back button, replacing the
  single-button navigation on boards that have no joystick of their own.

## CardKB

Plug it into the second I2C bus (the Grove connector on the Wio Tracker L1;
see [Wiring](#wiring-heltec-v3--v4) for the Heltec boards). The firmware probes
for it once at boot — nothing to enable in Settings.

The same bus is scanned for environment sensors, so a CardKB and a sensor can
share it.

On a board with no free pins for a second bus (ProMicro), CardKB instead
shares the primary bus already used by the display/RTC — set `CARDKB_I2C=Wire`
as a build flag rather than `ENV_PIN_SDA`/`ENV_PIN_SCL`. See
[Build Flags](./build_flags.md) for both forms.

### Typing

Printable characters insert straight at the cursor, bypassing the on-screen grid
completely. The alphabet and T9/ABC settings do not apply — a real keyboard sends
the right character already, so typing is always plain Latin ASCII regardless of
what Settings › Keyboard is set to.

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| letters / digits / symbols / space | insert at the cursor |
| Backspace | delete the character before the cursor |
| Esc | cancel / back |
| Arrows | same as the joystick |
| Enter | same as the centre button |
| **Fn+Enter** | **submit the field** — no need to find the DONE cell |
| **Fn+letter** | open the accent popup for that letter (e.g. Fn+A → á à ä ã…) |
| **Tab** | the Hold-Enter equivalent, everywhere — context menus, shift-lock, clear-all |
| **Fn+Esc** | lock / unlock the device (single press, works in both directions) |

Fn+Esc rather than the adjacent Fn+Backspace on purpose: Fn and Backspace sit
next to each other on CardKB's layout and would be far too easy to hit by
accident. See [Screen Lock](./screen_lock/screen_lock.md) for the physical
button equivalent.

### Ext. KB — Full vs Compact

**Settings › Keyboard › Ext. KB** picks how the on-screen keyboard behaves while
a CardKB is doing the typing.

| Mode | Behaviour |
| ---- | --------- |
| **Full** (default) | The letter grid stays on screen. Arrows and Enter drive the grid exactly as physical buttons do, so CardKB and the joystick can be used interchangeably. |
| **Compact** | The grid, the special-row icons and the status line are all hidden — only the text being typed and two shortcut hints remain. Arrows move the **text cursor** directly, and plain Enter submits the field (same as Fn+Enter). |

**Compact is designed to need no joystick at all** — the right choice when
CardKB is the only input device, e.g. a Heltec V3/V4 with no joystick
soldered on.

Cursor mode and the accent / placeholder popups draw their own visible feedback,
so they behave identically in both modes.

## Wired joystick

Four direction contacts plus a fifth "press" contact. Each contact simply
shorts its pin to ground — the firmware enables the internal pull-ups, so no
external resistors are needed.

- The stick's own press contact drives the centre / Enter press — your thumb
  is already on the stick, so pressing it in is the natural "confirm" action.
- The board's existing user button (PRG on the Heltec boards) becomes Back
  instead. Back is **not** optional: the UI uses it unconditionally once the
  joystick is enabled. Triple-clicking Back toggles the buzzer.
- **Settings › Display › Joystick rotation** rotates the direction mapping at
  runtime (0–3), for a stick mounted sideways in a custom enclosure. It is
  independent of display rotation.

## Wiring (Heltec V3 / V4)

Neither board ships with a joystick or a keyboard header, so both are soldered to
free GPIOs. The V3 and V4 Solo builds use different Up pins because GPIO2
controls the LoRa PA on V4. The corrected assignments follow Heltec's pin tables
and have not yet been checked on physical hardware; check your board revision
before soldering.

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| CardKB SDA | 3 | second I2C bus (`Wire1`) — *not* the OLED's 17/18 |
| CardKB SCL | 4 | |
| Joystick UP | **16 on V4 / 2 on V3** | V4 GPIO16 is on the small additional-pin header; V3 GPIO2 is on J3. GPIO23 does not exist on either board's ESP32-S3. |
| Joystick DOWN | 6 | |
| Joystick LEFT | 47 | |
| Joystick RIGHT | 48 | |
| Joystick press — Enter | 33 | the stick's own fifth contact; required when the joystick is enabled |
| Back | 0 | the onboard PRG button — nothing to wire |

Everything above lives in the `[env:Heltec_v3_companion_solo_dual]` /
`[env:heltec_v4_companion_solo_dual]` blocks in
[`solo/heltec_v3/platformio.ini`](../../solo/heltec_v3/platformio.ini)
and [`solo/heltec_v4/platformio.ini`](../../solo/heltec_v4/platformio.ini),
with comments explaining which pins are safe to reuse. To build a CardKB-only
device, comment out the joystick block and set Ext. KB to Compact.

## Built-in keyboards (Cardputer ADV, T-Echo Lite + KeyShield)

*Experimental* — newly-added board support, not the CardKB/joystick add-ons
above. Both keypads are TCA8418-based and share one polling path, entirely
independent of the CardKB code — a board can have either, or neither.

- **M5Stack Cardputer ADV** — built-in QWERTY, no CardKB or joystick needed.
- **LilyGO T-Echo Lite + KeyShield** — the KeyShield add-on gives the T-Echo
  Lite a T9 keypad; without it the board has no usable input for the solo UI.

Neither keypad follows CardKB's exact Fn-shortcut table (Fn+Enter,
Fn+letter accent popups, Tab, Fn+Esc lock) — see each board's own
keyboard driver under `variants/` and its solo `platformio.ini` under `solo/`
for its current keymap.
