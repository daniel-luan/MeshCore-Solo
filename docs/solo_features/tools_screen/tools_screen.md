The Tools screen is a hub for GPS trail recording, nearby node browsing, ringtone editing, the remote bot, auto-advert, live location sharing, locator, compass, clock tools (alarm / timer / stopwatch), device diagnostics, repeater mode, and remote admin. Tools are grouped into collapsible **Location** / **Comms** / **System** sections — the same fold-in-place model as Settings; Tools always opens folded back to the section list. Navigate with **UP/DOWN**, press **Enter** on a section header to expand or collapse it, or on a tool to open it.

## Nearby Nodes

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./nearby_oled.png) | ![](./nearby_eink.png) |

Browse nodes that have recently advertised on the mesh. **Filter** (which nodes) and **sort** (in what order) are independent axes and combine freely.

Filter by category with **LEFT/RIGHT**:

| Filter | Shows                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| All    | All known nodes                |
| Fav    | Favourites only (★)            |
| Comp   | Companion (chat) nodes         |
| Rpt    | Repeaters                      |
| Room   | Room servers                   |
| Snsr   | Sensors                        |

Select a node to see its coordinates, distance, bearing with cardinal direction, type, and last-heard time. A node that is **broadcasting its position** via Live Share is marked with a **♦ diamond** beside its name in the list (the same marker the map uses), and its detail shows `Sharing pos:` with the share age and whether it's DM-verified or channel-only. A **★ star** marks a favourite, which is also sorted to the top of the list unless **Settings › Contacts › Favs top** is off.

**Hold Enter** opens the same **Options** menu everywhere (list and detail), in a fixed order — only the actions that apply appear:

| Action                 | Available when                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigate               | selected node has GPS — for a node sharing live position, the view follows it as it moves and adds an ETA line |
| Ping                   | a public key is known for the node                                                     |
| Save waypoint          | selected node has GPS                                                                   |
| Set as target          | selected node has a position — pins it as the active **Locator/Nav target** right away (see **Locator**). A node with a known public key (a contact, a scan result, or someone sharing over DM) becomes a **person** target that keeps following them; a name-only row — someone sharing their position on a channel who isn't your contact — becomes a **place** target pinned where they were, since there's no identity to re-resolve |
| Fav: ON / OFF          | selected node is a saved contact — **LEFT/RIGHT** or **Enter** toggles it in place, as in the Messages menus; the same starred flag those lists use, shared with the companion app |
| Pin to dial / Unpin (slot N) | selected node is a saved contact — puts it on the [Favourites Dial](../favourites_dial/favourites_dial.md), taking the first free slot |
| Admin                  | selected node is a saved **repeater or room server** contact — opens **Tools › Admin** for it directly (see **Admin**) |
| Sort: Dist/Recent      | browsing stored nodes — **LEFT/RIGHT** or **Enter** flips distance ↔ last-heard in place |
| Discover scan / Rescan | always (live `NODE_DISCOVER_REQ` scan)                                                  |

Filtering stays on the list itself (**LEFT/RIGHT** cycles the type), so there is no separate Filter action in the menu. **Sort** is adjusted in place: highlight the **Sort** row and tap **LEFT/RIGHT** to flip the list (and its right-hand column) between **distance** and **last-heard** without closing the menu. The row appears only while browsing stored nodes (live-scan rows carry signal, not distance). Filter and sort are independent and **persist** across re-entry to the screen.

Selecting **Ping** opens the Ping popup:

|              OLED              |             E-Ink              |
| :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| ![](./nearby_ping_oled.png) | ![](./nearby_ping_eink.png) |

Use **Enter** on the popup’s `Ping` row to send a direct mesh ping to that node. The popup then shows the RTT and SNR values on the next lines, and can be used again immediately for another ping.

> [!TIP]
> Combined with **Auto-Advert** on the other device, Nearby Nodes becomes a passive location tracker — as long as the tracked device periodically broadcasts its GPS position, you can see its current distance and bearing without any manual interaction on either end.

### Active Discovery (live scan)

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./nearby_scan_oled.png) | ![](./nearby_scan_eink.png) |

**Options → Discover scan** sends a `NODE_DISCOVER_REQ`. Repeaters, sensors and room servers within zero-hop range respond immediately with name, type and signal data. This is not a separate screen — it is the **same list switched to a live-scan source**: the right-hand column shows **RSSI** instead of distance, and node detail shows the public key, signal data and contact status.

Because it is the same list, all the same keys apply — **UP/DOWN** to navigate, **Enter** for detail, **Hold Enter** for the Options menu (where **Rescan** repeats the scan and **Ping** works exactly as on stored nodes).

- **Cancel / Back** — return to the stored-nodes list

## GPS Trail

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./trail_summary_oled.png) | ![](./trail_summary_eink.png) |

Records your route in a RAM ring buffer (up to 512 points, sampled every 1 s). The track is **simplified as it's recorded** — a long straight stretch is kept as just its two endpoints while curves keep their detail (bounded to within the **Min dist** tolerance of the real path), so the buffer covers a far longer route than a flat point budget would suggest. Tracking runs in the background — a blinking **G** appears in the status bar. The trail survives display auto-off but is lost on reboot unless saved to flash first.

> [!TIP]
> The **Map** view is also reachable directly from the home carousel — the **Map** page shows a live mini-preview (your position, trail, and tracked contacts) with a **north marker** and a bottom-left **scale tick**. The status line below reads `Track:N` (tracked-node count) and, when you have a fix and at least one tracked contact, an **arrow + distance** to the **nearest** one (e.g. `Track:3 →120m`). If a **Locator/Nav target** is set it's drawn as a **flag marker** (see **Locator**). Press **Enter** to open the full Trail Map; **Hold Enter** shares your position (see **Live Share**); **Back** returns home.

A GPS fix indicator also sits in the top status bar, alongside the trail/auto-advert/repeater icons — boxed (lit) once the receiver has a valid fix, a plain glyph while still searching. It only appears on boards with GPS hardware and while **GPS** is turned on in Settings; it's hidden the rest of the time rather than sitting there empty.

Cycle views with **LEFT / RIGHT**:

| View        | Content                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary** | Distance, active tracking time, average speed (one decimal) or pace, point count, tracking status, latest altitude, total ascent/descent, and minimum/maximum altitude. Scroll with **UP/DOWN**. |
| **Map**     | Auto-fit dot-and-line plot with cos(lat) aspect correction; segment breaks marked; north arrow; square scale grid fitted to the map frame (toggle under **Hold Enter → Settings → Grid**, Map view only). Your **current GPS position**, all **waypoints**, and any **live-tracked contacts** (positions shared via Live Share) are always drawn — even with no trail recording — so the map is useful standalone. The active **Locator/Nav target**, if set, is drawn as a **flag** on top (folded into the frame so it's never off-screen). Point labels are auto-placed to avoid overlapping (a crowded cluster drops some labels rather than smearing them) |
| **Elevation** | Altitude plotted against distance along the retained trail, including the latest pending point. Height uses metres or feet; the horizontal axis uses the global distance units. Missing elevation and stopped/paused segments break the line. |
| **List**    | Per-point rows showing local time (HH:MM) and delta distance from the previous point; segment-start rows show `start`; scroll with **UP/DOWN**                      |

Elevation comes from GPS. Elevation recording requires HDOP at or below 3.0, or at least four satellites when the provider does not report HDOP; position recording continues even when height quality is poor. A five-sample median rejects isolated spikes, followed by exponential smoothing. Climb totals count accepted movement with a five-metre change threshold, avoiding accumulation while stationary. Height acquisition restarts after a poor/missing fix or pause, so a height difference across that gap is not counted as climbing. These are estimates, not barometric measurements.

Saved trails and GPX exports now include metre-resolution elevation; saved snapshots also retain climb totals and altitude extremes. Older saved trails still load and export, with unavailable elevation displayed as `--`. The profile covers retained points, while climb totals cover the recorded session, including points that have rolled out of the buffer. Altitude uses existing point padding, keeping the 512-point buffer at 8 KB. Reverting to older firmware requires a version 1 trail snapshot; older firmware cannot read new version 2 snapshots.

| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./trail_map_oled.png) | ![](./trail_map_eink.png) |

**Hold Enter** opens the **action menu**. It is two-level — a short main menu, plus **Trail file…** and **Settings…** submenus. **Cancel/Back** in a submenu returns to the main menu.

**Main menu:**

| Item                  | Action                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Start / Stop tracking | Begin or end a recording session. If **GPS is off**, choosing Start asks **"GPS is off — Enable GPS & start"** so a session can't silently run with nothing to record |
| Mark here             | Drop a waypoint at the current GPS fix (see below)  |
| Waypoints…            | Open the waypoint list / navigation / add-by-coords |
| Track back            | Retrace the recorded route back to its start (needs ≥2 points; see below) |
| Share my pos          | Send your current position as a one-shot `[LOC]` message — pick a contact or channel (see **Live Share**) |
| Trail file…           | Open the file submenu (below)                        |
| Settings…             | Open the settings submenu (below)                    |

**Trail file…** (only the operations that apply right now appear):

| Item           | Action                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Save trail     | Write RAM ring to flash (`/trail`)              |
| Load trail     | Restore flash trail into RAM                    |
| Export (live)  | Stream live RAM trail as GPX 1.1 over USB Serial |
| Export (saved) | Stream saved flash trail as GPX 1.1 over USB Serial |
| Reset trail    | Clear RAM ring and elapsed time — confirms first (defaults to Cancel) since there's no way back short of a prior **Save trail** |

**Settings…** (values cycle with **LEFT/RIGHT** or **Enter**; shown only where they apply):

| Item       | Available | Action                                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Min dist   | always    | Sample gate, 4 levels — metric: 5/10/25/100 m, imperial: 15/30/75/300 ft |
| Auto-pause | always    | OFF / 1 / 2 / 5 min — auto-freeze the trail after a stop, resume on movement (see below) |
| Mark avg   | always    | OFF / 5 / 10 / 30 s — GPS averaging for **Mark here** (see Waypoints below) |
| Auto-save  | always    | OFF / ON — auto-write the live trail to flash on shutdown, so a **low-battery auto-shutdown** doesn't lose the route (see below) |
| Readout    | Summary view | Summary shows Speed or Pace (in the global unit system) |
| Grid       | Map view  | Toggle scale grid on the map                            |

(Trail file… appears only when a live or saved trail exists. Mark here needs a GPS fix; Waypoints is always available.)

**Auto-pause** — when set, a recording trail automatically **pauses** after the device has stayed within ~15 m of one spot for the chosen delay: the elapsed timer and point sampling both freeze, and the map line breaks across the idle gap. It **resumes on its own** as soon as you move again. This keeps a stop (a break, a meal, parking) out of your distance and average-speed stats without you having to remember to stop and restart tracking. A paused trail is still "on" (the **G** marker keeps blinking) — the Summary **Status** row shows `paused`. The stop is detected with its own coarse movement gate, independent of **Min dist**, so GPS jitter while you're parked doesn't keep it awake.

**Auto-save** — with this on (default off), the live trail is written to flash automatically when the device powers off, so a **low-battery auto-shutdown** no longer discards the whole route. It saves to the same `/trail` file as the manual **Trail file… → Save**, and only writes when the trail actually has points — an empty trail can't overwrite a previously saved one.

### Track back

**Hold Enter → Track back** retraces your recorded trail back to the start — useful in poor visibility or unfamiliar ground. It reuses the navigation view (distance + two absolute bearings; see *Waypoints › Navigating*), but walks the recorded breadcrumbs in reverse: snaps to the **nearest recorded point**, guides you to it, then advances to the next earlier point as you reach each one (within ~20 m). The header shows points remaining (`Back: 12 pt`), reading `Trail start` on the final leg; arriving shows `Back at start` and exits. **Cancel** leaves track-back at any time. Needs a trail with at least two points and a GPS fix; tracking doesn't need to still be running.

### Waypoints

A waypoint is a saved spot — your car, camp, a water source — that you can navigate back to later. Waypoints are **independent of the trail**: they live in their own flash file (`/waypoints`), survive a reboot, and are **not** cleared by *Reset trail*. Up to 16 can be stored — the Waypoints list header shows how many are in use (e.g. `WAYPOINTS 3/16`).

**Dropping a waypoint** — **Hold Enter → Mark here**. This captures the current GPS fix and opens the on-screen keyboard for a short label (up to 11 characters — e.g. `CAR`, `CAMP`, `H2O`). Leaving it blank auto-names it `WP1`, `WP2`, … Marking works whether or not the trail is being recorded; it needs a GPS fix (otherwise it reports *No GPS fix*).

**GPS averaging** — with **Settings → Mark avg** set (5 / 10 / 30 s), *Mark here* doesn't snapshot a single fix; it samples the GPS once a second for that window and stores the **mean** position, for a steadier mark than one instantaneous reading (handy for a precise spot — a cache, a car, a trailhead). A short screen shows the time left and the sample count while it runs; **Cancel** aborts. When the window closes it opens the label keyboard as usual. With **Mark avg = OFF** (the default) marking is instant.

**Adding by coordinates** — open **Hold Enter → Waypoints** and select the **+ Add by coords** row (always the last entry in the list). This creates a waypoint without being there — no GPS fix required (handy for a meeting point or a spot read off a map). It opens a small form with three editable rows plus **Save**:

|           OLED             |           E-Ink            |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| ![](./waypoint_add_oled.png) | ![](./waypoint_add_eink.png) |

<!-- screenshot pending: Add-by-coords form — Lat/Lon scroll editor, hemisphere toggle, Label, Save -->


- **Lat** / **Lon** — **Enter** opens the digit-by-digit scroll editor (the same widget as the radio frequency field): **LEFT/RIGHT** move the cursor between decimal places, **UP/DOWN** change the digit under it, **Enter** confirms. With the editor closed, **LEFT/RIGHT** on the row toggles the hemisphere — N/S for latitude, E/W for longitude.
- **Label** — **Enter** to type a name (blank → auto `WP<n>`).
- **Save** — validates the range and stores the waypoint. Missing or out-of-range values report a brief error.

**On the map** — saved waypoints show as a hollow diamond with the label's first two characters beside it. Waypoints and your GPS position are drawn continuously, even with no trail recording, so the Map view doubles as a live "you + your marks" view. With **no trail**, it auto-fits to waypoints and position; **with a trail**, it frames the route instead, clamping any out-of-frame waypoint to the nearest edge so a distant mark can't blow up the scale.

**Navigating** — **Hold Enter → Waypoints** opens the list (each row shows the label and live distance). The list always begins with a synthetic **Trail start** row whenever a trail exists, so you can backtrack to where you began without having marked it. Select a row and press **Enter** to open the navigation view:

```
   CAMP            ← target label
   1.4 km          ← distance to target
   To:  145° SE    ← absolute bearing to the target
   Hdg: 090° E     ← your current course over ground (-- when stationary)
```

| :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| ![](./waypoint_nav_oled.png) | ![](./waypoint_nav_eink.png) |

<!-- screenshot pending: Waypoints navigation view — target label, distance, To/Hdg bearings (shared with Nearby/message Navigate) -->

There is no magnetometer, so the screen shows two *absolute* bearings and you compare them: target at 145°, travelling at 90° → bear right. The **Hdg** line is derived from GPS movement (see Compass) and reads `--` until you move. A fourth line shows closing speed and **ETA** once you're actually approaching. **Back** leaves the view — it's the only key that does, on every navigate view.

**Managing** — **Hold Enter** on a waypoint row offers **Rename** / **Delete** / **Send** / **Set as target** (the *Trail start* row is navigate-only). **Set as target** pins the waypoint as the active **Locator/Nav target** in one step (see **Locator**). Delete removes one at a time; there is no bulk clear.

**Sharing** — **Send** hands the waypoint to the Messages screen: pick a contact or channel, and the message is pre-filled as `[WAY]<lat>,<lon> <label>` (e.g. `[WAY]37.42123,-122.08456 CAR`) for you to confirm or edit before sending. On the receiving device, opening that message and **Hold Enter → Navigate / Save waypoint / Set as target** turns it back into a navigable point (see *Messages › Fullscreen message view*). The format is plain text, so it stays readable on other firmware and the phone app.

### Downloading GPX

**Easiest — [Solo GPX Downloader](https://marekzegare4.github.io/solo-tools/)** (browser-based, no install):

1. Open the link in **Chrome** or **Edge** (Web Serial API required).
2. Click **Connect device** and select the USB serial port.
3. On the device: **Tools › Trail** → **Hold Enter** → **Export (live)** or **Export (saved)**.
4. The browser captures the stream automatically — set a filename and click **Download**.

**Script — `tools/trail_export.py`** (auto-detects the port, captures from `<?xml` to `</gpx>`, writes a timestamped file under `tools/gpx/`):

```sh
uv run tools/trail_export.py
```

Then on the device: **Tools › Trail** → **Hold Enter** → **Export (live)** or **Export (saved)**.

**Manual fallback** — open a serial terminal at **115200 baud** and capture the stream by hand:

- **macOS/Linux** — `cat /dev/tty.usbmodem* > track.gpx` (stop with Ctrl-C after the dump finishes)
- **Windows** — PuTTY (Serial, 115200) or Arduino IDE Serial Monitor with no line ending; copy the text from `<?xml` to `</gpx>` into a `.gpx` file

Saved **waypoints are included** in the export as GPX `<wpt>` elements (with their label as `<name>`), alongside the track — so they show as pins in OsmAnd, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Studio, Google Earth, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> If the companion app is connected via **BLE**, the export is safe — BLE and USB operate independently. If connected via **USB**, disconnect the app before exporting.

---

## Auto-Advert

Periodically broadcasts a 0-hop advert with your GPS position. Configurable interval: OFF / 30 s / 1 min / 2 min / 5 min / 10 min / 30 min / 1 h. A blinking **A** appears in the status bar while active.

> [!TIP]
> **Audible connection heartbeat** — the device chirps on every *received* advert (sound in **Settings › Sound › AD sound**). With Auto-Advert on both ends (e.g. two hikers), each hears the other's periodic advert as a hands-free "in range" beep. It fires on **every** received advert, so a busy mesh gets chatty — set `None` in **AD sound** to silence just this, or **Advert scope** to `Zero-hop` to limit it to local adverts. **Settings › Sound › Buzzer** = *OFF* (or *Auto*, mutes while a companion app is connected) silences all buzzer output.

---

## Live Share

|           OLED             |           E-Ink            |
| :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| ![](./liveshare_oled.png) | ![](./liveshare_eink.png) |

<!-- screenshot pending: Live Share screen — Track loc / Auto share / To / Move / Min gap / Heartbeat rows -->

Share your live position over the mesh **as ordinary chat messages**, and put other people who do the same on your map. A position is sent as a `[LOC]<lat>,<lon>` message — the same coordinate format waypoints use, so it stays readable on other firmware and the phone app (it just looks like a coordinate to anything that doesn't know the tag).

This is **independent of Auto-Advert** and runs alongside it: Auto-Advert announces your *presence* as a 0-hop beacon for Nearby Nodes, while Live Share sends your *position* to a specific channel or contact you choose.

The tool holds both directions of sharing in one flat list. Navigate with **UP/DOWN**, change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter**); **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting    | Options                     | Notes                                                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Track loc  | ON / OFF                    | Receive incoming `[LOC]` shares (DM, monitored channels, and room-server posts) and pin those senders on the map / in Nearby. Off by default. |
| Auto share | ON / OFF                    | Periodically broadcast **your own** position to the target below while you move.                |
| To         | channel or contact          | **Enter** opens the Messages recipient chooser to pick the target channel or DM contact.        |
| Move       | 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 m      | Movement gate — only send after you've moved at least this far since the last share.            |
| Min gap    | 30 s / 1 / 2 / 5 min        | Minimum time between sends, so fast movement can't flood the channel.                           |
| Heartbeat  | OFF / 5 / 15 min            | Optional keep-alive: re-send even while stationary, so the other end knows you're still there.  |

**How auto-share decides to send.** The device checks a few times a minute and transmits once you've moved at least **Move** metres *and* **Min gap** has passed since the last send — a stationary device stays silent unless **Heartbeat** is set. It also sends once immediately on enabling sharing (or changing the target).

**Receiving.** With **Track loc** on, incoming `[LOC]` messages update a small live table (up to 16 nodes, entries expire ~20 min after the last update). DM shares are keyed by the sender's public key (reliable); channel and room-server shares are keyed by name (best-effort, since channel names are unsigned and a room post only carries a short sender prefix). Tracked nodes appear on the **Trail Map** as a filled diamond with the first two characters of their name, and in **Nearby Nodes** with their live distance/bearing.

**One-shot share.** To send your position once without enabling auto-share, use **Tools › Trail → Hold Enter → Share my pos** — it builds a `[LOC]` message and hands it to the Messages screen to pick a recipient. There's also a shortcut from the home **Map** page: **Hold Enter** sends an immediate position update to your Live Share target while auto-sharing is on (toast `Position shared`), or opens the recipient picker if it isn't — so you never broadcast to a default channel by accident.

<!-- screenshot pending: Locator screen with a target set (e.g. "@Bob (5m)"), radius/mode/beeper rows -->

A single **geofence** that beeps and alerts when you cross **into** or **out of** a radius. The target is either a **saved waypoint** (a fixed place — "tell me when I'm back at camp") or a **live contact** ("alert me when my friend gets near / falls behind"). A waypoint target is a **snapshot** — it keeps working even if you edit that waypoint later; a contact target follows their latest shared position. If the target waypoint or contact is deleted, the Locator target clears back to `none`.

Navigate with **UP/DOWN**, change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter**); **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting | Options                          | Notes                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alert   | ON / OFF                         | Master switch. Enabling without a target prompts you to pick one.                      |
| Target  | none / person / waypoint         | **Enter** opens a picker — **None** first (clears the target), then your **favourites** (offered even with no known position yet, so you can arm ahead of time), then any other contact with a currently-resolvable position (live-sharing *or* just last-advertised, e.g. a repeater), then waypoints; **UP/DOWN** + **Enter** to choose. **LEFT/RIGHT** quick-cycles the same set in place, including back to **None**. A person is shown with an `@` prefix, a ★ when they're a favourite, plus a compact **age tag** (e.g. `@Bob (5m)`) when the position is last-advertised rather than a live share. Shows `none` until set. |
| Radius  | 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 m / 1 km    | Geofence size.                                                                          |
| Mode    | Arrive / Leave / Both            | Which crossing fires the alert — entering the radius, leaving it, or both.              |
| Beeper  | ON / OFF                         | Optional homing tone — shown only in **Arrive** / **Both** modes (see below).           |

**Crossing alert.** When armed with a target, the device watches its own GPS fix and fires the alert (a short melody plus an on-screen message) the moment you cross the radius, according to **Mode**. The wording adapts to the target — `Arrived` / `Left` for a waypoint, `Near` / `Away` for a person. The edge has a little hysteresis so a fix hovering right on the boundary doesn't chatter, and the first reading after arming only seeds the in/out state — it won't fire spuriously just because you armed it while already inside.

**Following a person.** Pick a **favourite** (or any contact with a known position) as the target and the geofence tracks the distance *between you and them*, working while both of you move. Position resolves with a fixed precedence: an active live `[LOC]` share wins, falling back to the contact's last-advertised position otherwise — so a stationary node (a repeater, or a one-time fix) still works. You can arm ahead of time — a favourite locks onto their pubkey, and the alert starts once a position is known. Live following needs a **DM** share (a channel share has no stable identity); the last-advertised fallback works for any contact.

**Proximity beeper.** With **Beeper** on, the device ticks while inside the radius, shortening the gap as you get closer — slow near the edge, rapid near the centre — like a homing beeper. Silent outside the radius. As an opt-in toggle, it **overrides the global buzzer mute** — an explicit "I want to hear this." It only appears in **Arrive**/**Both** mode (hidden and silent in **Leave**-only). Independent of the crossing alert, which does follow the mute — use either or both.

**Setting the target from anywhere.** Besides this screen's picker, the *same* active target can be set in one step with **Set as target** from the **Hold Enter** menu of **Nearby Nodes**, **Waypoints**, or a message carrying a location — handy so you don't need a detour through Tools. Picking from this screen's picker saves on exit (so **LEFT/RIGHT** cycling stays cheap); the per-item shortcuts save immediately and confirm with a `Target set` toast.

**On the map.** Whatever the active target is — person or waypoint — it's drawn as a **flag marker** on both the home **Map** preview and the full **Trail Map**, on top of any waypoint/contact it overlaps and folded into the frame so it never sits off-screen. This shows even when the **Alert** master switch is off, so a target you set purely to navigate to still appears.

## Compass

<!-- screenshot pending: Compass — scrolling heading tape with centre pointer + large degrees/cardinal readout -->

A heads-up GPS compass. No magnetometer, so heading is **course over ground** — derived from how your GPS position moved over the last few seconds. Display is a horizontal **heading tape**: a fixed pointer at centre, N..E..S..W scrolling underneath as you turn, so whatever's under the pointer is your course. A large numeric readout below shows it in degrees and cardinal (e.g. `145° SE`).

Since heading comes from movement, it only updates while moving — standing still shows *move to set heading* (navigation's **Hdg** reads `--`). Gross GPS jumps are rejected so one bad fix can't swing it. Runs on any GPS fix; recording a trail is **not** required.

| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./ringtone_oled.png) | ![](./ringtone_eink.png) |

A step sequencer for composing custom notification melodies. Two slots — **Melody 1** and **Melody 2** — switchable from within the editor.

Each melody supports up to 32 notes:

| Parameter | Options                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Pitch     | C / D / E / F / G / A / B / pause |
| Octave    | 4 – 7                             |
| Duration  | 1/4 / 1/8 / 1/16 / 1/32           |
| BPM       | 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180         |

**Navigation in the editor:**

- **LEFT/RIGHT** — move between notes
- **UP/DOWN** — change pitch of selected note
- **Enter** — cycle octave of selected note
- **Hold Enter** (or context menu) — open options menu

**Options menu:**

| Item         | Interaction | Action                                 |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Play / Stop  | Enter       | Preview the melody                     |
| Melody 1 / 2 | Enter       | Switch to the other slot               |
| Duration     | LEFT/RIGHT or Enter | Cycle duration for selected note |
| BPM          | LEFT/RIGHT or Enter | Step tempo (stops at each end)  |
| Insert       | Enter       | Insert a new note after the cursor     |
| Delete       | Enter       | Delete the note at cursor              |
| Save & Exit  | Enter       | Persist the melody and return to Tools |
| Discard      | Enter       | Return to Tools without saving         |

Melodies can be assigned in **Settings › Sound** (global default) or overridden per contact or channel from the Messages screen context menu.

## Remote Bot

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./autoreply_oled.png) | ![](./autoreply_eink.png) |

<!-- screenshots pending: these predate the tab-carousel layout below (still show the old flat grouped list) -->

Automatically replies to incoming messages containing a configured trigger word (case-insensitive, contains match). Pack multiple phrases into one Trigger field, comma-separated (`hi,hello there,yo`) — any one matches; spaces around each phrase are trimmed. Three independent targets — **DM**, a monitored **Channel**, and a monitored **Room** — each with its own trigger/reply pair.

The screen is a **circular tab carousel** (same style as Nearby Nodes' filter tabs): **LEFT/RIGHT** switches between **Channel** / **Room** / **Direct** / **Other** (opens on Channel), **UP/DOWN** moves within the active tab, **Enter** acts on the selected row (LEFT/RIGHT is reserved for tab-switching — every value changes via Enter, not in-place cycling).

Each target has its own **Enable** toggle on its own tab, and they're fully independent — you can run only a channel bot, only a room bot, only DM, or any combination, with no need to also switch on the others.

Each target also has its own **Commands** toggle (see below) — DM, channel and room can each independently answer `!` queries or stay quiet, same as Enable.

#### Channel tab

| Setting | Description                                                                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable  | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Independent of which channel is picked below, so switching it off and back on remembers the last channel. |
| Channel | Which channel the bot monitors — always shows the last-picked channel (or `(none)` if none exist yet), regardless of Enable. **Enter** opens the full channel picker (the same one Live Share's **To** row uses). |
| Commands | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Answer `!` query commands on the monitored channel, independent of the other two tabs' Commands settings. |
| Trigger | Independent trigger for the monitored channel. `*` means **reply to every channel message** — bounded by the per-channel cooldown, but use sparingly on a busy channel. |
| Reply   | Reply text for channel messages; supports the same placeholders as Direct's Reply. |

#### Room tab

| Setting | Description                                                                      |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable  | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Independent of which room is picked below.          |
| Room    | Which room server the bot posts to — always shows the last-picked room (or `(none)` if you have none yet), regardless of Enable. **Enter** opens the full room picker. Picking a room you've never logged into prompts for its password right there — the bot can't post to a room it has no working login for, so this is the moment to set one up. |
| Commands | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Answer `!` query commands on the monitored room, independent of the other two tabs' Commands settings. |
| Trigger | Independent trigger for the monitored room. `*` means **reply to every post in the room**. |
| Reply   | Reply text for room posts; supports the same placeholders as Direct's Reply.      |

#### Direct tab

| Setting    | Description                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable     | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Enables DM listening.                              |
| DM allow   | **All** / **Fav** — **Enter** toggles. Who the DM bot (trigger-reply and commands) responds to. All (default): any DM sender. Fav: only contacts you've starred (the same star Settings › Contacts filters on) — use this to keep a public bot from being spammed by strangers while it still answers people you trust. |
| Commands   | ON / OFF — **Enter** toggles. Answer `!` query commands (see below) in DMs.      |
| Trigger    | Word or phrase that activates the DM reply (case-insensitive). A lone `*` means **reply to every DM** (away mode) and is shown as `(any msg)`. **Enter** opens the keyboard. |
| Reply      | Reply text for DMs; supports `{time}`, `{loc}`, `{name}`, `{hops}` and sensor placeholders. **Enter** opens the keyboard. |

#### Other tab

| Setting       | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quiet from    | **Enter** opens a stepper (value shown bracketed, e.g. `[14:00]`) — **UP/DOWN** steps the hour, **Enter**/**Cancel** confirms. Local-time window start; set from = to (`OFF`) to disable quiet hours entirely. Applies to all three targets' trigger-replies. |
| Quiet to      | Same stepper; window end.                                                        |

The DM, channel and room triggers are independent, so you can run e.g. an away-message (`*`) in DMs while the channel or room reacts only to a specific keyword (or vice-versa).

`{name}` (the triggering sender's name) and `{hops}` (`direct` or `N hops`) are only meaningful when replying to an actual incoming message, so — unlike `{time}`/`{loc}`/the sensor placeholders — they're offered only while editing a **Reply** field here, not on the general message-compose keyboard.

The header shows a running count of auto-replies sent since boot, alongside the tab bar.

**Room posting requires a login.** The room bot reuses whatever session the device already has with that server (Messages › Rooms › **Login…**, or a password saved earlier / from the phone app) — it can't prompt for one itself in the background. If the saved password stops working, it silently stops posting there; log back in from Messages to fix it.

**Throttle.** DM auto-replies are rate-limited **per contact** (10 s), so a second sender is never starved while one contact is on cooldown. The channel and room bots each keep their own single 10 s cooldown and won't echo a message identical to their own reply (so two bots running the same reply text on one channel/room can't ping-pong); the cooldown caps any residual back-and-forth.

**Quiet hours** suppress the push (trigger) replies between the configured local hours; a window where *from* is later than *to* wraps past midnight. Commands are a pull (explicitly requested), so they answer even during quiet hours.

### Commands

With a tab's **Commands** ON, a message beginning with `!` on that target is answered with live node data, independent of the trigger:

| Command   | Reply                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `!ping`   | `pong`                                  |
| `!batt`   | battery voltage                         |
| `!loc`    | GPS coordinates (or `no GPS`)           |
| `!time`   | local time `HH:MM`                      |
| `!temp`   | temperature (or `n/a` if no sensor)     |
| `!hops`   | how many hops the command message took to reach the node (`direct` if heard directly) |
| `!status` | combined battery / location / time      |
| `!help`   | list of available commands              |

Several commands can be combined in one message — `!batt !time !hops` is answered with a single `4.10V | 14:30 | 3 hops` reply (one transmission). A message with no recognised command falls through to the trigger bot.

Each target's Commands toggle is independent — e.g. answer `!ping` in DMs but stay quiet on a busy public channel. Channel and room replies are broadcast/posted to everyone there, so unlike DM commands they respect quiet hours and use their own shared cooldown. DM commands use the per-contact throttle and the **DM allow** scope above.

### Actions

A separate **Actions** toggle, nested under Commands (Commands must be ON for Actions to do anything) — these commands change the device's own behaviour, not just report on it, so they default OFF and are kept independent of the read-only Commands toggle:

| Command          | Effect                                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!buzz [seconds]` | Sounds the buzzer as a find-me signal — default 5s, capped at 30s. Sounds even if the buzzer is muted in Settings (that's the point of a find-me signal). |
| `!gps on` / `!gps off` | Enables/disables GPS, same effect as the Home page's GPS toggle.  |
| `!gps fix [seconds]` | Single-shot location: turns GPS on if needed, waits for a stabilised fix (HDOP ≤ 2.0, or ≥8 satellites without HDOP, averaged over 10s), sends the position, then restores GPS's prior state. Two-part reply — immediate `GPS: acquiring fix...` ack, then the position (or `GPS: no fix (timeout)` / partial fix) up to `seconds` later (default 90s, 15–300s range — raise it under poor sky view). Only one in flight at a time; a second gets `GPS: fix already pending`. |
| `!advert`         | Sends an advert immediately, same as the Home page's manual advert action. |

Actions combine with Commands and each other in one message the same way — `!batt !gps on` answers with `4.10V | GPS: on` in a single reply. With Actions OFF for a target, `!buzz`/`!gps`/`!gps fix`/`!advert` are silently ignored (no reply, no effect) exactly like any other unrecognised command, and `!help`'s reply doesn't mention them.

On boards with user GPIO (see **GPIO** under System tools below), the same Actions gate also covers `!gpio1`..`!gpio4`.

<!-- screenshot pending: Diagnostics — live device/mesh stats rows (uptime, rx/tx counters, heap, RSSI/SNR, queue, errors) -->

A circular tab carousel of live device and mesh stats, refreshed once a second (same tab idiom as Remote Bot / Nodes). **LEFT/RIGHT** switches tab; **UP/DOWN** scrolls within it on a small OLED — on a larger e-ink display a tab's rows all fit at once.

| Tab | Shows |
| --- | ----- |
| **Live** | Live counters — see table below. |
| **System** | Static device identity: firmware version + build date, device model, node name, and the active radio parameters. |
| **Font** | A rendering test card — one sample line per script the on-device font claims to cover (Latin, diacritics, Greek, Cyrillic, digits, symbols), so its coverage can be eyeballed directly. |

**Live** tab rows:

| Row          | Shows                                                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Total rx/tx  | All received / transmitted packets, summed across the categories below                             |
| Msg          | Text and group-text packets, `rx/tx`                                                                |
| Advert       | Advert packets, `rx/tx`                                                                             |
| Ack/Path     | Ack, path-return and trace packets, `rx/tx`                                                         |
| Other        | Everything else (requests, responses, control, raw, …), `rx/tx`                                    |
| Forwarded    | Packets this node actually re-transmitted as a repeater (reflects overhear suppression, if on)     |
| Heap free    | Free / total heap                                                                                  |
| Stack free   | Current task's minimum-ever stack headroom                                                          |
| Noise floor  | Live radio noise floor (dBm)                                                                        |
| RSSI/SNR     | Signal strength / signal-to-noise of the last received packet                                      |
| Pool free    | Free entries in the packet pool                                                                     |
| Queue        | Packets waiting in the outbound queue                                                               |
| Errors       | Radio error flags since boot/reset — `OK`, or tokens `F` (queue full), `C` (CAD timeout), `R` (RX-start timeout) |
| RXPS wd s/h  | RX duty-cycle watchdog recovery count, `soft/hard` — how many times the background watchdog has re-armed (soft) or fully reset (hard) a stuck duty-cycle sequencer. Stays `0/0` unless Settings › Radio › **Pwr save** is on and something actually went wrong. |

The packet counters, **Forwarded**, **Errors** and **RXPS wd s/h** are cumulative since boot. On the **Live** tab, **Hold Enter** opens a *Reset counters?* confirm (defaults to Cancel); the live readings (noise, RSSI/SNR, pool, queue, uptime) are not affected. **Cancel/Back** returns to the Tools list.

The counters make the repeater behaviour observable: **Forwarded** confirms the node is actually relaying (not just configured to), and **Pool free** / **Queue** show whether forwarding is exhausting the packet pool. See **Tools › Repeater** for the relaying options.

## GPIO

*Board-specific — currently Wio Tracker L1 only.* Four otherwise-unused pins (GPIO1-GPIO4) are exposed for general-purpose use. Each pin gets its own row showing its current mode; **Enter** (or LEFT/RIGHT) cycles it through **OFF → Input → Output** and back to OFF — GPIO1 and GPIO2 additionally step through **Analog** between Output and OFF (GPIO3/GPIO4 have no ADC channel, so their cycle skips it). Switching a pin's mode shows a brief confirmation (`GPIO1: Input`, `GPIO1: Output`, …).

Once a pin is set to **Output**, a second **State** row appears right underneath it — **Enter** toggles it **ON**/**OFF**, with its own confirmation. The direction (Mode row) and the on/off state (State row) are deliberately separate: changing one never surprises you by also changing the other.

- **Input** shows its live level inline on the Mode row: `Input (High)` / `Input (Low)`, refreshed continuously.
- **Analog** (GPIO1/GPIO2 only) shows a live millivolt reading inline instead: e.g. `1650mV`. Has no State row — it's read-only.
- **Output** shows just `Output` on the Mode row; the actual ON/OFF value lives on the State row below it.

The same 4 pins are reachable remotely via the Remote Bot's `!gpio1`..`!gpio4` commands (see **Actions** under Remote Bot below) — both paths read/write the same underlying state, so the Tools screen and the bot never disagree. A bare `!gpio1` reports the pin's current mode and reading (`gpio1: out on`, `gpio1: in on`, or `gpio1: 1650mV` in Analog mode); `!gpio1 on`/`!gpio1 off` only takes effect if that pin is currently set to Output here (otherwise the bot replies "not output", including when the pin is in Analog mode).

Turns the companion into a packet **repeater** while it keeps working as a normal companion — no separate firmware. By default, enabling it switches the radio to a dedicated repeater profile rather than relaying on your chat network (see **Network** below), matching the MeshCore community norm of repeaters sitting on a standard channel. Loop-detection and an advert flood-depth cap always apply. Live forwarding stats are on **Tools › Diagnostics**.

Navigate with **UP/DOWN**; change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter** for toggles). **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting        | Options         | Notes                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repeater       | ON / OFF        | Master switch. The options below are always visible, so the profile and filters can be set up before switching it on. |
| Network        | Current / Custom | **Custom** _(default)_: enabling the repeater switches to a dedicated profile (below), disabling restores the companion's settings. A never-configured device seeds Custom from your own network's band (433/868/915 MHz region), not a flat default, so it can't land outside what's legal for your region. **Current**: relay on the companion's own frequency — opt-in, not the community norm. |
| Preset         | named presets   | _(Custom only)_ **Enter** picks a community/saved preset for the repeater profile. |
| Freq           | chip range      | _(Custom only)_ **Enter** opens the digit-by-digit editor (chip-validated bounds). |
| SF / BW / CR   | 5–12 / 7.8–500 kHz / 5–8 | _(Custom only)_ **LEFT/RIGHT** to adjust the profile's spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate. |
| Skip advert    | ON / OFF        | Don't re-flood **advert** packets (the highest-volume flood traffic); messages and acks still relay.           |
| Max hops       | OFF / 1–8       | Drop a flood packet once it has already travelled this many hops.                                              |
| Yield          | OFF / x2–x9     | Scales the retransmit delay for **forwarded** floods only (your own sends are unaffected), so a mobile companion defers to better-sited fixed repeaters. Widens the window for **Suppress dup**. |
| Min SNR        | OFF / −20…10 dB | Drop a flood copy received below this signal-to-noise threshold, so marginal fringe traffic isn't re-flooded.   |
| Suppress dup   | ON / OFF        | If the same flood packet is overheard from another node while still queued to retransmit, cancel our copy — a peer already relayed it. Cuts redundant airtime in dense meshes; pairs with **Yield**. |
| Scope only     | ON / OFF        | Only forward flood traffic matching this device's own default **Scope** (Settings › Radio) or one of the **Extra scopes** below — drops unscoped floods and floods tagged for a different community. No-op while neither is set, so switching this on with no scope configured can't silently stop all relaying. |
| Extra scopes   | pick list       | Extra scopes this repeater also relays for, on top of its own Settings › Radio default **Scope** — relay-only, never changes what scope this device's own messages send under. Shows `N picked`. **Enter** opens a checklist of the Settings › Radio scope list (**Enter** toggles a row, **Back** closes); at most 4 are active. Shows `No scopes defined` until at least one named scope exists. |

The flood filters (**Skip advert** through **Scope only**) are **opt-in** (default OFF, so a plain repeater is unaffected) and act on **flood** traffic only — on a direct route this node is the named next hop, so it never drops those.

**Same network vs. separate network.** With **Network = Current** (or a Custom profile matching your companion settings) the repeater stays on your own network — you keep messaging while relaying. A *different* Custom profile moves the device entirely onto that network while relaying (one radio can't be on two at once), returning to your own network when switched off. The profile re-applies after a reboot if the repeater was left on.

While on, a **»** indicator appears in the status bar (same blink convention as auto-advert/trail markers). Two radio settings are overridden and restored afterwards: **Pwr save** forced off (must listen continuously) and **Auto pwr** forced off (full TX power for relay reach). Both show `--` in Settings while active.

Live forwarding stats — **Forwarded**, **Pool free**, **Queue** — are shown on **Tools › Diagnostics** (this screen is config-only).

## Admin

<!-- screenshot pending: Admin — target picker, command entry, reply view -->

Send commands to a **repeater/room server you have admin permission on** — the on-device equivalent of the companion app's repeater-admin feature. See [CLI Commands](../../cli_commands.md) for the full command grammar. (Admin only manages *remote* nodes; this device's own name, radio, TX power and reboot live in **Settings** — see below.)

1. **Select a node** — **Tools › Admin** opens straight into **Tools › Nodes** (same screen, filters, sort, live scan), so picking a node for Admin looks like using Nodes normally; **Enter** on a repeater/room row hands it to Admin, **Cancel** returns to Tools. Also reachable from a node's own **Hold Enter** menu in Nodes.
2. **Log in** — type the node's **admin password** (same handshake Messages uses for rooms; set on a repeater with the `password` CLI command). A saved password from an earlier login retries silently. Only **admin**-level permission unlocks the next step — anything less shows "Not admin on this node".
3. **Pick a category and a field** — a tab carousel (**LEFT/RIGHT** to switch category, **UP/DOWN** to move within it, same as Remote Bot's tabs), so common settings don't need the CLI grammar memorised:

   | Tab | Rows |
   | --- | ---- |
   | **System** | Name, Owner info, Admin password |
   | **Radio** | Frequency, Bandwidth, Spreading factor, Coding rate, TX power |
   | **Routing** | Repeat, Advert interval, Flood advert interval, Max hops |
   | **Actions** | Send advert, Send zero-hop advert, Sync clock, Reboot, Start OTA, **Custom command...** |

   **Enter** on a row does one of four things, depending on the field:
   - **Name / Owner info** first **fetch** the node's current value, then open the keyboard **pre-filled** with it to edit — submitting sends the change. If the fetch fails or times out, the keyboard still opens (blank), so the value can be set blind.
   - **Radio and Routing rows** are typed, not free text: **Repeat** is an ON/OFF toggle; **Advert interval / Flood advert interval / Max hops / TX power** are number steppers (**LEFT/RIGHT** to adjust, within that field's valid range); **Frequency** uses the same digit-by-digit cursor editor as Settings' own Radio screen (**LEFT/RIGHT** moves between digits, **UP/DOWN** changes the selected one); **Bandwidth / Spreading factor / Coding rate** step through their valid discrete LoRa values with **LEFT/RIGHT**. All four Radio-tuple fields (Frequency/Bandwidth/SF/Coding rate) fetch and re-send the same underlying `radio` value together — editing any one of them still only overwrites that one, the other three round-trip unchanged. **Enter** sends the change; **Cancel** discards it and returns to the row list without sending anything.
   - **Admin password** has no fetch (there's no way to read a password back) — it opens straight to a blank keyboard.
   - **Actions** (Send advert, Sync clock, …) send immediately, no editing step — except **Reboot** and **Start OTA**, which both ask first (defaulting to Cancel): they take the remote out of action for a while with no way to intervene on an unattended node if something goes wrong.
   - **Custom command...** (last row of Actions) opens the same free-text entry for anything not covered above — up to 160 characters, see the linked reference for the full grammar. The keyboard's **{}** key doubles as command completion here: it lists commands matching whatever's typed since the last space (narrowing as you type), and picking one completes that word instead of just inserting after it.
4. **Read the reply** — the text reply opens in a scrollable view (**UP/DOWN** to scroll, **Cancel/Enter** to go back to the category tabs).

> [!WARNING]
> This screen can run **destructive** commands on the *remote* node — `reboot`, `erase`, a new admin password, and others. That's the same capability the phone app's repeater-admin feature already exposes, not a new risk, but double-check the value and the target before sending.

**Passwords are remembered across reboots**, same self-healing behaviour as room logins in Messages: a successful login is saved, so picking that node again — even after a power cycle — logs back in silently. A password that stops working is forgotten on failure, prompting fresh next time. A correct password that just lacks admin permission is left alone. Commands marked **Serial Only** in the CLI reference reject a remote request and only work over that node's own USB serial.

### This device

Admin doesn't manage the companion itself — its own settings live in **Settings**: **Radio** (preset / freq / SF / BW / CR) and **TX power** in the Radio section, and **Name** and **Reboot** in the System section. **Send advert** is the home **ADVERT** page.
