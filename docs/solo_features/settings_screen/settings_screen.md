All settings are saved to flash and restored on next boot. Settings are organised into collapsible sections. Press **Enter** on a section header to expand or collapse it — all sections start collapsed for faster navigation. Press **LEFT/RIGHT** to change a value. **Enter** advances any row whose options wrap around — toggles, melodies, and option lists like Auto-off. Rows that ramp between fixed ends (Brightness, Volume, TX Pwr, Timezone, SF / BW / CR) are LEFT/RIGHT only, since there is nothing to wrap to.

Press **Cancel/Back** to save and return to the home screen.

### Sound

| Setting        | Options                        | Notes                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buzzer         | ON / OFF / Auto                | Auto: silences while BLE connected, re-enables on disconnect |
| Volume         | 1–5                            | LEFT/RIGHT; preview tone plays on each change                |
| DM Melody      | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Notification sound for incoming private messages. `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| Channel Melody | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Notification sound for incoming channel messages. `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| AD sound       | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Sound played whenever an **advert** is received from *any* node — pairs with Auto-Advert as an audible "in range" heartbeat (see Tools › Auto-Advert). `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| AD scope       | All / Zero-hop                | Filters the AD sound so it plays for every advert or only for local zero-hop adverts. |

Melody 1 and Melody 2 are custom sequences editable in **Tools › Ringtone Editor**.

| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./homepages_oled.png) | ![](./homepages_eink.png) |

Lists all available home screen pages. For each entry:

- **LEFT / RIGHT** — move the page earlier or later in the navigation sequence
- **Enter** — toggle the page ON / OFF

**Settings** and **Messages** are always visible and cannot be disabled.

### Radio

| Setting   | Options    | Notes                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TX Pwr    | 2–22 dBm   | LEFT/RIGHT. With **Auto pwr** on this is the *ceiling* — the radio may transmit lower. On the **GAT562 30S** (external 30 dBm PA) the requested power maps through the PA's measured gain curve, so the stored value matches what is radiated; this row stays capped at 22, while the phone app / CLI can request up to 30 dBm — see [Build Flags › External PA](../build_flags.md#external-pa--tx-power-curve). |
| Preset    | named presets | LEFT/RIGHT cycles community RF presets (region frequency + bandwidth/SF/CR). **Enter** opens a popup to pick one, save the current settings as a named preset, or delete a saved one — deleting confirms first (defaults to Cancel). Applies frequency, bandwidth, SF and CR together. |
| Freq      | chip range | **Enter** opens a digit-by-digit editor: LEFT/RIGHT moves between decimal places, UP/DOWN steps that digit. Bounds come from the radio chip's own validated range, so a value the radio would reject can't be entered. |
| SF        | 5–12       | LEFT/RIGHT. Spreading factor. |
| BW        | 7.8–500 kHz | LEFT/RIGHT cycles the standard LoRa bandwidths. |
| CR        | 5–8        | LEFT/RIGHT. Coding rate (4/5–4/8). |
| Pwr save  | ON / OFF   | **Battery saver.** Hardware duty-cycle receive (SX126x only): cycles RX↔sleep, wakes on preamble, cuts average RX current at the cost of some latency. **Forced off (`--`) while the repeater is on** — restored once it's switched off. A background watchdog auto-recovers if the sequencer gets stuck (soft re-arm, then a full reset) — see Tools › Diagnostics for the counts. |
| Auto pwr  | ON / OFF   | **Adaptive Power Control.** Lowers TX power on strong links, ramps back to the **TX Pwr** ceiling on weak/lost ones. Link quality from DM ACK SNR, or — for channels (no ACK) — a repeater's rebroadcast. Live power shown on the radio page/name bar. Default OFF. **Suppressed (`--`) while the repeater is on** — restored once it's switched off. |
| Ext LNA  | ON / OFF   | Heltec V4 only. Toggles the external KCT8103L receive amplifier immediately with LEFT/RIGHT or Enter and saves the choice when leaving Settings. Defaults to ON for existing devices. Shows `--` on V4.2 hardware, whose GC1109 LNA cannot be switched off in software. This is separate from the SX1262's internal RX boosted gain. |
| Scope     | list       | Shows the list's **default** scope. **Enter** opens the **SCOPE** list: `*` (wildcard = unscoped, always first, can't be renamed or deleted) plus up to 8 named scopes of your own (e.g. `pl`). Typing a name derives a shared key the same way on every device, so any device that types the same name lands on the same scope automatically, no key exchange needed. **Enter** on a row opens **Set as default** / **Rename** / **Delete** (delete confirms first); **+ Add scope** at the bottom opens the keyboard. The **default** scope (marked `[default]`) governs **DMs** and the **repeater's own relay slot**; each **channel** carries its own pick — set from the channel's context menu (see [Message Screen](../message_screen/message_screen.md)) — and a channel left on `*` sends unscoped. Scopes tag flood traffic so repeaters can tell your community's messages apart from others sharing the same frequency; paired with **Tools › Repeater › Scope only** it's also what this device relays for in repeater mode. The default also syncs both ways with the phone app's default-scope setting. Not encryption — message content is unaffected either way. Upgrading from a build with the old single Scope field carries it over as the default entry and seeds every existing channel with it, so nothing changes on the air. |

The **repeater** mode and its flood filters live on their own screen — see **Tools › Repeater**, including how it uses **Scope** above.

### System

| Setting     | Options                                             | Notes                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | keyboard entry (up to 31 chars)                     | This device's node name, shown to others and in every advert. **Enter** opens the keyboard pre-filled with the current name; applied and saved on submit |
| Timezone    | −12 h … +14 h                                       | UTC offset in whole hours                                                              |
| Low battery | OFF / 3.0 V / 3.1 V / 3.2 V / 3.3 V / 3.4 V / 3.5 V | Auto-shutdown threshold; also sets the 0 % anchor for the battery percentage indicator |
| GPS pwr _(if GPS detected)_ | OFF / 1 min / 5 min / 15 min / 30 min / 1 h | **Battery saver.** Cycles GPS off between fixes; each wake waits up to 60 s for a fix before sleeping again. Stays continuously on whenever something needs a live position — Trail recording, Live share, an armed Locator, Compass/Nearby, or an in-flight `!gps fix`. `OFF` (default) = always-on, as before. Status icon blinks while napping. |
| Units       | Metric / Imperial                                   | Global unit system for every distance/speed shown in Tools (Nearby Nodes, Trail, navigate-to-point). Metric: m / km, km/h, min/km. Imperial: ft / mi, mph, min/mi |
| Reboot      | action (**Enter**)                                  | Restarts this device. Pending setting changes are saved first. Last row, so it isn't the default-selected one |

### Keyboard

| Setting  | Options    | Notes                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layout   | ABC / T9   | On-screen keyboard style. **ABC**: a-b-c…z grid, one key per letter. **T9**: phone-keypad multi-tap — each key labelled digit+letters (e.g. `2abc`); repeated **Enter** cycles the letters then the digit. Applies to whichever script page is active, not just Latin. |
| Main | Latin / Cyrillic / Greek | Which script the keyboard opens on by default. **Latin** is the default; picking **Cyrillic** or **Greek** makes that the one you land on, with Latin moving to the Additional cycle instead. |
| Additional | Latin / Cyrillic / Greek | The second script in the **#@/abc** key's cycle (Main → Additional → Symbols → Main). Setting it to the same script as Main drops the cycle to just that script plus Symbols. **Greek** covers the 24-letter alphabet plus final sigma (`ς`), not the tonos stress accents. Every script renders natively via one shared Unicode font — no separate toggle needed. |
| Ext. KB | Full / Compact | Only shown on a build with CardKB support (`CARDKB_I2C` or `ENV_PIN_SDA`/`ENV_PIN_SCL` set). Picks how the on-screen keyboard behaves while a CardKB is doing the typing — see [External Keyboard & Joystick](../external_keyboard.md#ext-kb--full-vs-compact). |

Applies to every on-screen text field (messages, waypoint labels, room passwords, preset names).

European Latin-diacritic letters (Polish, Czech, Slovak, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Nordic, etc.) aren't separate alphabet pages — instead, **Hold Enter** on a plain Latin letter that has accented variants (`a c d e i l n o r s t u y z`) opens a one-row popup of its accents (e.g. holding `a` offers `á à â ã ä å ą`); **LEFT/RIGHT** picks, **Enter** inserts it, **Cancel** dismisses with no change. Holding a letter with no accented variants (e.g. `b`) does nothing. Works on whichever page is currently showing Latin, whether that's Main or Additional.

### Contacts

| Setting  | Options   | Notes                                       |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| DMs      | All / Fav | Show all chat contacts or only favourited ones |
| Channels | All / Fav | Show all channels or only favourited ones      |
| Rooms    | All / Fav | Show all room servers or only favourited ones  |
| Favs top | ON / OFF  | Sort favourites to the top of every list (default ON) |
| Expire   | Off / 7d / 30d / 90d | Age after which a contact with no advert/update counts as inactive (default Off). Only used by **Prune now** — nothing is ever deleted automatically. |
| Prune now | action (**Enter**) | Counts the contacts older than **Expire**, then asks `Remove N contacts?` (defaults to Cancel) before deleting anything. Shows `Expire is Off` / `No inactive contacts` instead when there is nothing to do. |

Favourites are set per item in its context menu (**Hold Enter** › **Fav: ON / OFF**) — see [Message Screen](../message_screen/message_screen.md), and the same row exists in Tools › Nodes. A contact's or room's favourite flag is the same one the companion app shows as a starred contact, so it syncs both ways; a channel's is device-only.

A favourite is marked with a ★ on its row wherever it is listed, and — unless **Favs top** is off — sorted above everything else. The three filters above are independent of that: they control what's *listed at all*, the sort only controls the order.

**Pruning.** A contact is inactive when its last advert/update is older than **Expire**. **Favourites are never pruned**, and neither is a contact with no timestamp or one that reads ahead of the device's own clock (e.g. the clock isn't set yet) — the rule only ever errs on the side of keeping data.
