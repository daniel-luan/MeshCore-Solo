| ProMicro *(experimental)* | nRF52840 | SSD1306 128 × 64 | `solo-<version>-ProMicro.uf2` |

All firmware files are published on the [releases page](https://github.com/MarekZegare4/MeshCore-Solo/releases). Each binary supports both BLE and USB serial — there are no separate BLE/USB builds.

The MCU column decides how you flash: nRF52840 boards take a drag-and-drop `.uf2`, ESP32-S3 boards take a `.bin` written with a flasher — see [Flashing](#flashing).

The Wio Tracker L1s, both GAT562 boards and Cardputer ADV work out of the box (the Cardputer has a built-in QWERTY keyboard). Heltec V3/V4 need [a keyboard or joystick wired up](#hardware-setup--heltec-v3--v4) first. The T-Echo Lite needs the KeyShield add-on (its own T9 keypad) to be usable standalone. ProMicro has no onboard buttons at all — a CardKB is required, sharing the board's primary I2C bus — see [External Keyboard & Joystick](./docs/solo_features/external_keyboard.md).

## Feature highlights

- Extended language support — one unified 6×9 font (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic) plus on-screen keyboard alphabets for Cyrillic, Greek, Polish, Czech, Slovak, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Nordic. Pick two in Settings › Keyboard (**Main**/**Additional**) and switch between them while typing

- Enabled sensor screens with support for onboard sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, luminosity, CO₂) and GPS data

- **GPS navigation** — a full navigation suite that needs no extra hardware (details in the [Tools Screen](./docs/solo_features/tools_screen/tools_screen.md) docs):

  - **Waypoints** — mark a spot (car, camp, water…) with a short label, see it on the trail map, and get live bearing + distance back to it; the list always offers a one-tap backtrack to where your trail started
  - **GPS compass** — heading derived from course-over-ground (no magnetometer needed), shown as a clear scrolling heading tape with a large degrees + cardinal readout
  - **Navigate to anything** — a saved waypoint, a node straight from Nearby Nodes, or a location someone shares with you in a message
  - **Share & save locations** — send a waypoint to a contact or channel; on the other end, navigate to or save any shared location with one menu
  - **Live location sharing** — broadcast your position over the mesh as you move (movement-gated, to a channel or contact) and see others who share theirs as pins on the map and live distance/bearing in Nearby
  - **Locator** — arm a geofence around a waypoint or a person, get alerted on arrive/leave or near/far, with an optional homing beeper that speeds up as you close in. Set from the Locator screen, Nearby Nodes, or Waypoints; target shown as a flag on the map
  - **GPS trail** — background route recording with an auto-fit map (waypoints + live position), summary stats, auto-pause on stops, and [GPX export](#solo-tools)
  - **Metric or imperial** — one global Units setting drives every distance and speed across the UI

- [Messages Screen](./docs/solo_features/message_screen/message_screen.md) — view and send messages, open message details, reply with quick messages or custom text, navigate to / save locations shared in a message, per-channel notification and melody overrides, add/edit/delete channels on-device

- [Favourites Dial](./docs/solo_features/favourites_dial/favourites_dial.md) — pin up to six contacts for quick access from the home screen

- [Settings Screen](./docs/solo_features/settings_screen/settings_screen.md) — configure display, sound, home page order, radio and system settings

- [Clock Screen](./docs/solo_features/clock_screen/clock_screen.md) — view time and date plus up to three configurable data fields, with built-in clock tools (one-shot alarm, countdown timer, stopwatch)

- [Screen Lock](./docs/solo_features/screen_lock/screen_lock.md) — lock the device to prevent accidental keypresses, with a lock screen showing time and sensor data

- [Tools Screen](./docs/solo_features/tools_screen/tools_screen.md) — GPS trail & waypoints, compass, nearby nodes (with ping & navigate), ringtone editor, remote bot, auto-advert, live location sharing, locator, diagnostics, repeater, remote admin

- [External Keyboard & Joystick](./docs/solo_features/external_keyboard.md) — optional, auto-detected: **CardKB** for typing without the on-screen grid (Fn+Enter submits, Fn+letter picks an accent, Tab is Hold-Enter, Fn+Esc locks), plus a **wired joystick** for boards without one. Compact mode makes CardKB-only operation practical

- **Battery saving (radio)** — two optional, independent toggles under Settings › Radio:
  - **Pwr save** — hardware duty-cycle receive (SX126x `SetRxDutyCycle`): the radio cycles RX↔sleep on its own and wakes on a preamble, cutting average RX current with only a little added receive latency
  - **Auto pwr** — Adaptive Power Control: trims actual TX power on strong links (from ACK SNR) and ramps back up to the configured ceiling on weak/lost links; the home screen shows the live power

### E-ink Display (Wio Tracker L1)

The e-ink variant targets the Wio Tracker L1 fitted with a 2.13″ GxEPD2 panel (250 × 122 px). Every screen is adapted for it:

- **Adaptive layout** — every screen reflows correctly in both landscape (250 × 122) and portrait (122 × 250) orientations
- **Display rotation** — configurable in Settings › Display; applied immediately and persisted across reboots
- **Joystick rotation** — independent of display rotation; useful for custom enclosures
- **Full refresh interval** — configurable in Settings › Display; reduces ghosting on long sessions
- **Clock seconds suppressed by default** — seconds are hidden to reduce per-second panel refreshes and extend display lifetime; re-enable in Settings › Display

## Flashing

> [!WARNING]
> When migrating from official or other custom firmware, backup your data and **perform a factory reset** to prevent conflicts with existing settings:
>
> 1. Open device settings in the companion app and download a data backup
> 2. Go to [MeshCore Flasher](https://meshcore.io/flasher), select your device, and perform **Erase flash** before flashing
>
> Updating from an earlier Solo release does not need this, unless the release notes say otherwise.

### nRF52840 boards — Wio Tracker L1, GAT562, T-Echo Lite + KeyShield

1. Download the `.uf2` file for your device from the [releases page](https://github.com/MarekZegare4/MeshCore-Solo/releases)
2. Press reset twice quickly to enter bootloader mode — the device should appear as a mass storage drive on your computer
3. Copy the `.uf2` file to the drive to flash the firmware

### ESP32-S3 boards — Heltec V3, V4, Cardputer ADV

ESP32-S3 has no UF2 bootloader and no mass-storage mode. Releases ship a single **`-merged.bin`** per board — bootloader, partition table and app in one image — which goes to offset `0x0`:

- **[MeshCore Flasher](https://meshcore.io/flasher)** or any Web Serial ESP tool — select the `-merged.bin` and flash at `0x0`
- **esptool** — `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 write_flash 0x0 solo-<version>-<device>-merged.bin`

> [!NOTE]
> Building from source also produces an app-only `firmware.bin`. It belongs at offset `0x10000` and needs a bootloader already on the chip — flashing it at `0x0`, or onto a freshly erased chip, leaves the device dead-silent. `pio run -e <env> -t upload` writes bootloader, partition table and app at their correct offsets in one go; a hand-flashed single `.bin` doesn't. Releases only ship the merged image, so this only matters when building yourself.

### Connecting the companion app

Applies to every board: each binary serves the companion app over **both** BLE and USB serial, but not at once.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BLE has priority over USB serial. While a BLE connection is active the USB protocol is suspended. To connect the app over USB, disconnect from BLE first or disable BLE directly on the device.

## Hardware setup — Heltec V3 / V4

A single PRG button can't drive the solo UI. Both Solo builds enable an **M5Stack CardKB** and a **wired joystick** by default. The joystick's Up pin differs between V3 and V4:

| Function | GPIO | Notes |
| -------- | :--: | ----- |
| CardKB SDA | **3** | second I2C bus (`Wire1`) — *not* the OLED's 17/18 |
| CardKB SCL | **4** | |
| Joystick UP | **16 (V4)** / **2 (V3)** | V4 GPIO16 is on the small additional-pin header; V3 GPIO2 is on J3 |
| Joystick DOWN | **6** | |
| Joystick LEFT | **47** | |
| Joystick RIGHT | **48** | |
| Joystick press — Enter | **33** | the stick's own fifth contact; required whenever the joystick is enabled |
| Back | **0** | the onboard PRG button — nothing to wire |

Each joystick contact simply shorts its pin to GND — the firmware enables the internal pull-ups, so no external resistors are needed. CardKB needs power and ground alongside SDA/SCL; check your unit's own voltage rating before picking a rail.

> [!NOTE]
> The old Solo builds assigned Up to GPIO23, which does not exist on the ESP32-S3. The corrected Up pins follow Heltec's pin tables; this revised joystick wiring has not yet been checked on physical hardware. Check your board revision before soldering.

Either device is enough on its own — unwired pins read as not-pressed, and a missing CardKB just isn't detected at boot. For **CardKB-only**, wire just SDA/SCL and set Settings › Keyboard › **Ext. KB = Compact**, which needs no joystick at all.

These are only defaults, set in the `[env:Heltec_v3_companion_solo_dual]` / `[env:heltec_v4_companion_solo_dual]` blocks in [`solo/heltec_v3/platformio.ini`](./solo/heltec_v3/platformio.ini) and [`solo/heltec_v4/platformio.ini`](./solo/heltec_v4/platformio.ini) — comments there list which GPIOs are already claimed. Full details in [External Keyboard & Joystick](./docs/solo_features/external_keyboard.md).

## Solo Tools

All solo builds include screenshot and GPX trail export support out of the box — no special build flags required.

### Web app — nothing to install

Open [Solo Tools](https://marekzegare4.github.io/Solo-tools/) in a browser with Web Serial support (Chromium-based) and click **Connect device**:

- **Screenshot** — capture the current display contents as a PNG. Triggered entirely from the browser; nothing to press on the device.
- **GPX export** — stream the recorded GPS trail and download a timestamped `.gpx` file. Start it on the device with **Tools › Trail › Hold Enter › Export** once connected.

### Offline equivalents

The same two features are available as local scripts — `tools/screenshot.py` and `tools/trail_export.py` — plus a font converter. See [tools/README.md](./tools/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both routes use USB serial, suspended while a BLE connection is active — disconnect BLE first. If the app is connected over **USB**, disconnect that too, or the raw export stream disrupts its frame protocol. (Safe over BLE, since USB receive is ignored then.)

## Development

This fork tracks the upstream [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) repository. To prevent upstream changes from overwriting this README during merges, `README.md` is protected via `.gitattributes`. After cloning, run once:

```sh
git config merge.ours.driver true
```

### Building from source

| Environment | Device |
| ----------- | ------ |
| `WioTrackerL1_companion_solo_dual` | Wio Tracker L1 (OLED) |
| `WioTrackerL1Eink_companion_solo_dual` | Wio Tracker L1 (E-ink) |
| `GAT562_30S_Mesh_Kit_solo_dual` | GAT562 30S Mesh Kit |
| `GAT562_Mesh_Watch13_solo_dual` | GAT562 Mesh Watch13 *(experimental)* |
| `Heltec_v3_companion_solo_dual` | Heltec LoRa32 V3 *(experimental)* |
| `heltec_v4_companion_solo_dual` | Heltec LoRa32 V4 *(experimental)* |
| `M5Stack_Cardputer_ADV_companion_solo_dual` | M5Stack Cardputer ADV *(experimental)* |
| `LilyGo_T-Echo-Lite_keyshield_companion_solo_dual` | LilyGO T-Echo Lite + KeyShield *(experimental)* |
| `ProMicro_companion_solo_dual` | ProMicro (nRF52840) + CardKB *(experimental)* |

```sh
pio run -e <env>                                  # build only
pio run -e <env> -t upload                        # build and flash over USB
FIRMWARE_VERSION=v1.0.0 bash build.sh build-firmware <env> # release artifacts into out/
```

The last command runs the same path CI does: a `.uf2` + DFU `.zip` on nRF52, or an app-only `.bin` plus a `-merged.bin` on ESP32. Releases carry the `.uf2`, the `.zip` and the `-merged.bin` only.

Every environment above builds as-is with no extra hardware required. If you've
wired up something extra — CardKB, a joystick, GPIO, a magnetic cover sensor,
a buzzer — see [Build Flags](./docs/solo_features/build_flags.md) for the full
list of optional `-D` flags to add to your own `solo/<board>/platformio.ini`.

### Releasing

Pushing a `v*` tag runs [Build Solo Firmwares](./.github/workflows/build-solo-firmwares.yml), which discovers every `*_solo_dual` environment automatically, builds them all and opens a **draft** release with the artifacts attached. Write the notes from `release-notes.md` and publish it. See [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) for the upstream companion/repeater/room-server tags.

### Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
| ---- | -------- |
| `examples/companion_radio/ui-new/` | the solo UI — screens, widgets, `UITask` |
| `src/helpers/ui/` | display drivers, fonts, buttons, buzzer |
| `variants/<board>/` | per-board `platformio.ini`, `target.h`, `target.cpp` |
| `solo/<board>/` | that board's solo (`*_solo_dual`) environment — kept separate from `variants/` so this fork's Solo-specific additions don't mix into configs upstream/other forks also carry |
| `docs/solo_features/` | user documentation for this fork |
| `docs/design/`, `docs/development/` | developer notes and the feature roadmap |
| `tools/` | host-side helpers (screenshot, GPX export, font conversion) |
